[h1]Mod Introduction[/h1]
The mod adds the function of custom chore types to the game.

[h2]Modifying Task Types:[/h2]
[olist]
[*]Switch to the "Errands" tab on the details menu page
[*]Right-click the task title
[*]In the pop-up "select" window, select the task type(s) you want to set for this task (multiple selections are allowed; the button background turns green when selected)
[*]Click the "CONFIRM" button to immediately modify the task type
[/olist]

[h2]Restoring Default Settings:[/h2]  
If you have modified the task type of a task, a "Delete" button will appear in the "Select" pop-up window. Clicking "Delete" will restore the default settings.
Note:
[b]This mod will generate a custom_chore_types_config.json file in the Klei\OxygenNotIncluded\mods folder. 
This file records modifications made in the game. To avoid losing your changes, do not delete this file.[/b]
[b]Since I'm not yet familiar enough with the UI code, the "Select" pop-up window is designed to close as soon as the cursor exits it.[/b]
